multicolumn primary key
CREATE TABLE `jokecategory` (

Because the DatabaseTable class is inside the Ninja prefix, without the backslash prefix PHP will 
to load the class \Ninja\PDO rather than the inbuilt PHP class PDO.
The PDO class is in something called the global namespace—that is, a class that
exists at the very top level, effectively not inside a namespace. To reference a
class in the global namespace, we must prefix it with a backslash

"autoload": {
      "psr-4": {
      "Ninja\\": "classes/Ninja",
      "Ijdb\\": "classes/Ijdb"
   }
}
this inside composer to resolve these namespaces correctly
